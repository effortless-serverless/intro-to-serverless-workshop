# Intro to serverless workshop [WIP]

_with Node.js and AWS Lambda_

This workshop is work in progress.

This workshop is about creating your very first serverless application. You will learn how serverless works, then we'll work together to create a serverless API and deploy it to AWS Lambda and API Gateway. You will also learn how to connect your functions with the database and add authentication and autorization.

Hope you'll enjoy it!
